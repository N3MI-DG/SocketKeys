/**
 * Frame metadata only — deliberately no component imports here. This module

 * importing the actual components here would create a circular import.
 * The id -> component mapping lives in App.vue instead, the one place that's
 * not itself inside the cycle.
 *
 * webPanels.ts is safe to import here despite that: it's a data-only leaf
 * module (like this one), not a component, so it can't be part of that cycle.
